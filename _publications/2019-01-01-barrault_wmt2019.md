citation: "@inproceedings{barrault-EtAl:2019:WMT,  abstract = {This paper presents the results of the premier shared task organized alongside the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) 2019. Participants were asked to build machine translation systems for any of 18 language pairs, to be evaluated on a test set of news stories. The main metric for this task is human judgment of translation quality. The task was also opened up to additional test suites to probe specific aspects of translation.},  address = {Florence, Italy},  author = {Barrault, Loïc  and  Bojar, Ondřej  and  Costa-jussà, Marta R.  and  Federmann, Christian  and  Fishel, Mark  and  Graham, Yvette  and  Haddow, Barry  and  Huck, Matthias  and  Koehn, Philipp  and  Malmasi, Shervin  and  Monz, Christof  and  Müller, Mathias  and  Pal, Santanu  and  Post, Matt  and  Zampieri, Marcos},  booktitle = {Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, Day 1)},  category = {ACTI},  month = {August},  pages = {1--61},  publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},  title = {Findings of the 2019 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19)},  url = {https://loic.barrault.github.io/papers/barrault_wmt2019.pdf},  year = {2019} }  "
